Ingredients

⦁	600g bread flour

⦁	One packet of instant yeast. 7 grams.

⦁	7-10 grams of fine salt e.g table salt.

⦁	360 grams warm water OR 420 grams. If you use the first amount it’ll give you a 60% hydration dough, The second quantity 70%. 70% is harder to work with but dries out less in the oven. Your decision. I use 70%.

⦁	Between 15g-30g vegetable oil (helps dry out less and assists with browning take your pick on the amount you can skip it entirely too if that’s your thing)

⦁	1 or 2 tablespoons of sugar (helps with browning and is a nice balance to the yeast and salt flavouring gives the bread a pretzel bagel type flavour. You can again omit this entirely if that’s your thing.
